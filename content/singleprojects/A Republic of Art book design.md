| **Typography** Font, purchased for the publication was Maison Neue and Maison Neue Mono | Exhibition. Eindhoven, Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, 27-06-2015, 04-10-2015. - E-publication and catalog for the eponymous group exhibition. What do artists and their work reveal about the time and place in which they live? How does a country collect art? Can a French identity be distilled from a contemporary art collection that consists of art from around the world? The exhibition "A Republic of the Arts" raises interesting questions. "A Republic of the Arts" tells the story of contemporary art since the 1980s from a French perspective. More than 100 influential works from the collections of the FRACs (Fonds RÃ©gionaux d'Art Contemporain), many of them shown outside France for the first time, fill the ten rooms of the museum's old building. |
